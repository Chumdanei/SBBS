		    <p style="color:black;"> Your booking request has been rejected.</p>
		    <p style="color:black;">We are really sorry for not confirming your booking request.</p>
			<p style="color:black;">Since there is no bus or driver on the time you have requested, we are not able to make it for you. Anyway you can still book on that we have provided by clicking <a href="http://10.10.1.58:8080/">here</a>.</p>
			<br><p style="color:black;">Hopefully, you would understand our problems.</p><br>
		    <p style="color:black;">Regards,</p>
